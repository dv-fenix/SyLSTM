# Syntax-based LSTM (SyLSTM) - Coming Soon!
This is a PyTorch implementation of the Syntax-based LSTM (SyLSTM) for the task of fine-grained offensive language detection, as described in our paper:

"Leveraging Dependency Grammar for Fine-Grained Offensive Language Detection using Graph Convolutional Networks" published at SocialNLP @ NAACL-HLT 2022.
